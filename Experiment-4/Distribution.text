LIVE CHARACTER COUNTER FUNCTIONALITY & STYLING OVERVIEW

1. FEATURE: Character Counting
- The counter updates in real-time as users type in the textarea.
- It counts all characters including spaces, numbers, and symbols.
- Implemented using JavaScript 'oninput' event.

2. PAGE STRUCTURE (HTML Overview)
The HTML structure consists of:
- A container <div> that wraps the textarea and the counter display
- A <textarea> for user input
- A <div> showing "Character count:" followed by a <span> that displays the number

3. CSS LAYOUT
- Textarea spans full width with padding.
- Character count is styled bold.
- Responsive layout: textarea resizes with screen width.

4. COLOR SCHEME & STYLING NOTES
Default Light Mode:
- Background: white
- Border: light gray around textarea
- Text: black

Styling Notes:
- Uses width: 100% for responsiveness.
- Padding for readability.
- Bold character count.

5. TEST CASE DISTRIBUTION

1. FEATURE: Library Book Management Component

The application provides a dedicated Library Management component where users can view, add, and manage books.

Each book entry typically includes details such as Title, Author, and Availability.

The component is modular, built with React (LibraryManagement.js and LibraryManagement.css), making it reusable and maintainable.

The UI ensures users can easily track book records in a structured way.

2. PAGE STRUCTURE (React Component Overview)

The React component structure consists of:

- A main wrapper <div> with a class for layout and styling.
- A header <h2> displaying “Library Management System” (or similar title).
- Input fields (like text boxes or dropdowns) to add new books or search existing ones.
- A <table> that organizes book records in rows with columns such as Book Title, Author, Status (Available / Issued).
- Buttons for user actions like Add, Edit, or Delete books.

3. CSS LAYOUT & STYLING

The design follows a clean and professional layout:

- Container box with padding and a subtle border for separation.
- Tables styled with border-collapse: collapse for neat rows and columns.
- Table headers highlighted with a background color for better readability.
- Input fields and buttons styled consistently to maintain a smooth user experience.
- Responsive adjustments allow the UI to work on various screen sizes.

4. COLOR SCHEME

- Container Background: White (for clarity).
- Borders: Light gray for table cells, darker borders for main sections.
- Table Header Background: Soft gray (#f5f5f5).
- Buttons: Contrasting color (e.g., blue or green) to stand out.
- Text: Default black for maximum readability.

DYNAMIC PRODUCT FILTER FUNCTIONALITY & STYLING OVERVIEW

1. FEATURE: Category Filter Dropdown
- The project allows users to filter products dynamically using a dropdown menu.
- Categories include All, Clothing, Electronics, and Books.
- Selecting a category immediately updates the product list without reloading the page.

2. PAGE STRUCTURE (HTML Overview)
- The page has a container that holds all content.
- A heading is used to title the section ("Product List").
- A label and dropdown appear at the top to select categories.
- A table is used to list products in two columns: Product Name and Category.
- Each product row is linked to its category using a data-category attribute.

3. CSS LAYOUT & STYLING
- The container is styled with a thin black border, padding, and white background.
- The dropdown has padding and a light border for neatness.
- The table uses border-collapse to create clean grid lines.
- Table headers are styled with a light gray background.
- Rows have a consistent border and spacing for readability.

4. COLOR SCHEME
- Container Background: White
- Outer Border: Black
- Table Cell Borders: Light gray
- Header Background: Light gray
- Text: Black

6. FILE DISTRIBUTION
- index.html → Contains the structure of the page: container, heading, dropdown, and product table.
- style.css → Defines the layout and visual styling: borders, colors, table formatting, and dropdown styling.
- script.js → Provides interactivity: listens to dropdown changes and shows/hides products dynamically based on category.
EVENT LISTENERS
- The JavaScript uses an event listener attached to the dropdown (select element).
- The "change" event is triggered whenever the user selects a different category.
- This event listener calls a function that applies the filtering logic.

7. DOM SELECTION
- JavaScript selects the dropdown element using getElementById("category").
- Product rows inside the table are selected using querySelectorAll("tbody tr").
- Each row is linked to a category using the custom attribute data-category.

8. DATA ATTRIBUTES
- The products are categorized using HTML data attributes (example: data-category="clothing").
- In JavaScript, these values can be accessed through row.dataset.category.
- This technique allows a clean separation of content (HTML) and logic (JavaScript).

9. CONDITIONAL LOGIC
- When the user changes the dropdown selection, JavaScript checks the selected value.
- If the value is "all", all rows are displayed.
- Otherwise, each row is compared against the selected category and only matching rows remain visible.


10. LEARNING OUTCOMES
- Understand how to use a dropdown to filter data dynamically.
- Learn to use data attributes (data-category) for classification.
- Practice clean file separation between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Apply user-friendly table formatting for clarity.

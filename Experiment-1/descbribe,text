This is a student registration web page built using HTML and styled with CSS. The page includes two identical forms where users can enter their Name, Email, and Age, then submit the information. The HTML ensures all fields are required, with limits on name length and age range. The CSS styles the page with a soft antiquewhite background and centers the header. Each form has a blue background, padding, rounded corners, and is aligned using flexbox for a clean layout.

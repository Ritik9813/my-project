1. FEATURE: ProductCard Component Using Props

This application includes a reusable React component named `ProductCard` which is designed to display product details dynamically using props.

Each card displays a product's Name, Price, and Stock Status in a visually structured format.

The component is modular, implemented using React (`ProductCard.jsx` and `ProductCard.css`) and can be reused across different parts of the application without modifying the component code.

The purpose of this component is to demonstrate how to pass and render dynamic data using props in React.

2. PAGE STRUCTURE (React Component Overview)

The React component structure consists of:

- A main wrapper `<div>` for layout and styling using a container class.
- A header `<h1>` displaying “Products List”.
- A `.map()` loop that renders multiple `ProductCard` components with different props.
- Each `ProductCard` displays:
  - Product Name
  - Product Price
  - Stock Status (e.g., "In Stock" or "Out of Stock")

3. CSS LAYOUT & STYLING

The component layout is designed to be clean and responsive:

- Product cards are styled with borders, padding, and drop shadows for a card effect.
- Text is center-aligned within each card.
- Cards are arranged using flexbox for a responsive horizontal layout.
- Font sizes and spacing are optimized for clarity and balance.

4. COLOR SCHEME

- Container Background: White
- Card Border: Light gray
- Shadow: Subtle dark gray (for elevation)
- Text: Black (high readability)
- Optional: Stock status could be color-coded (green/red) in future improvements

6. FILE DISTRIBUTION

src/ProductCard.jsx
- Reusable React component that accepts props for `name`, `price`, and `status`.
- Displays a single product card.

src/ProductCard.css
- Styling for the card layout, padding, border, and text formatting.

src/App.jsx
- Imports and renders multiple `ProductCard` components.
- Contains the product data as an array of objects and maps over them to display cards dynamically.

src/App.css
- Styles for the page layout (e.g., container, flexbox for card alignment).

src/main.jsx
- React entry point that renders the `<App />` component into the DOM.

7. LEARNING OUTCOMES

- How to pass and receive props in React components.
- Creating modular and reusable UI components.
- Using `.map()` to render multiple components from an array of objects.
- Combining JSX, CSS, and props to build structured and styled UIs.
